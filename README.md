## üöÄ Projects

### üîß Back to the Basics

Delving deep into the core fundamentals of computing, because sometimes the most 'basic' things are deceptively complex. Here are some projects where I strip everything down to the bare metal to understand how things really work:

- [rustylox](https://github.com/mvishiu11/rustylox) - My own interpreter for the Lox language, crafted in Rust, inspired by the *Crafting Interpreters* book. Also provides [live playground](https://mvishiu11.github.io/rustylox-playground).
- [CoreLox](https://github.com/mvishiu11/CoreLox) - Reimplementation of Lox as bytecode-based virtual machine, written from scratch in C. While RustyLox brought Lox to life in Rust, CoreLox strips it down to its essentials‚Äîminimalist, efficient, and purpose-driven. This is Lox interpretation, closer to the metal. 
- [torchlet](https://github.com/mvishiu11/torchlet) - A neural network library influenced by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd, extended to integrate seamlessly with PyTorch. Includes essential optimizations and C extensions for heavy computations via Cython.
- [grep](https://github.com/mvishiu11/grep) - A reimagined take on the classic regex matching tool, built from scratch with handcrafted regex logic.
<!-- - **carbonlox** - An evolution of rustylox, rewritten in C with a bytecode-based architecture that boosts speed significantly. -->

### ü§ñ AI/ML Projects
Artificial Intelligence is a constant in my work, and I've tackled numerous applications in both proprietary and personal projects. Here are a few of my personal ventures:

- [KANwise](https://github.com/mvishiu11/kanwise): Implementation of Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold Networks (KANs) in PyTorch with a Keras-like interface, based on the KAN paper.

- [torchlet](https://github.com/mvishiu11/torchlet): A full neural network library inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd, extended with PyTorch integration and optimized using Cython.

- [Speech2Text](https://github.com/mvishiu11/speech2text): A FastAPI-based Speech-to-Text API using OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper for transcription. Features user tracking and support for REST/WebSocket requests.

### üéì Academic Projects at Warsaw University of Technology
During my time at the Warsaw University of Technology, I‚Äôve worked on some exciting and challenging projects. Here's a sneak peek:

- [Flight Application](https://github.com/mvishiu11/FlightApplication): A comprehensive flight data management system for my OOD course. The project demonstrates parsing, serializing, and deserializing flight data using a console interface, and includes multiple modules such as FlightDataParser, NetworkDataParser, and FlightDataGUI for managing and visualizing data.

- [Battleships Game](https://github.com/mvishiu11/BattleshipsGame): A fully functional Battleship game written in WinAPI as part of my PiGE course. Classic game, modern code. Well, maybe not totally modern, given that it's WinAPI...

- [ADS (Algorithms and Data Structures)](https://github.com/mvishiu11/ads): A collection of algorithm and data structure implementations in C++. This is my go-to reference for brushing up on fundamentals and a learning resource for others.

### üéÆ For Fun & Miscellaneous Projects
Not everything has to be serious! Here are some projects I work on for fun or experimentation:

- [Genom Motif Analyzer](https://github.com/mvishiu11/Genome-Motif-Analyzer): A simple, yet elegant tool for identifying, analyzing, and visualizing DNA motifs in genome sequences using BioPython.

- [CUDA-NPP-EdgeDetection](https://github.com/mvishiu11/CUDA-NPP-EdgeDetection): This project showcases a GPU-accelerated edge detection pipeline using both a custom Sobel filter implemented in CUDA and the highly optimized NVIDIA NPP library. 

- [graphs-isomorphism](https://github.com/mvishiu11/graphs_isomorphism): A Python project for checking isomorphism in simple, undirected graphs. Includes a neat visualization tool using PyVis.

- [AdventOfCode2023](https://github.com/mvishiu11/adventofcode2023): My solutions to Advent of Code 2023. I'm learning Go in the process but may switch to C, C++, or Python when things get tricky (or when I feel adventurous).

- [C-projects](https://github.com/mvishiu11/C-projects): A collection of early C projects from my first semester. This is where it all began, and I keep it around to see how far I‚Äôve come.
